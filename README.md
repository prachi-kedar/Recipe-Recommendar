# Gen AI Recipe Recommender

## What it Does

This project uses Gemini Model to suggest recipes based on the ingredients you have. Tell it what you have (like "chicken and tomatoes"), and it will recommend recipes you can make.

## How it Works

1.  **AI Learns Recipes:** It reads lots of recipes and learns what ingredients are similar.
2.  **You Tell It Ingredients:** You enter what food you have.
3.  **AI Finds Similar Recipes:** It uses AI to find recipes that use your ingredients.
4.  **AI Suggests a Recipe:** It uses another AI to suggest a specific recipe you can make.
   
## What You Need

* Python

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python and the programs listed.
2.  Get a file with lots of recipes (like `RAW_recipes.csv`).
3.  Run the Python code.
4.  The code will ask what ingredients you have.
5.  It will then suggest a recipe!
